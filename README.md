# TicTacToe_Muskan

Tic-Tac-Toe Game - It is a two-player game implemented in C++. Players alternate turns placing Xs and Os on a 3Ã—3 board, aiming to align three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when a player wins by achieving this, or when the board is fully occupied, resulting in a draw. The board is managed using a 2D array, and moves are input through the console with validation checks ensuring proper gameplay.
