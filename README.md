Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed in C++. It allows two players to take turns and play the game, with built-in logic to detect wins, draws, and validate player inputs.

Features:

Two-Player Mode: Players alternate turns to mark the board with 'X' or 'O'.
Win Detection: The game detects when a player wins by aligning three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Draw Detection: The game checks for a draw condition when all squares are filled without a winner.
Input Validation: Ensures that players select valid, unoccupied squares for their moves.
